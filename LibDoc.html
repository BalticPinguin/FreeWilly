<!-- Main content -->

<h1 id="main">Main:</h1>
<p> This page is not intended to be an exhaustive libmesh-documentation nor a complete reference list.
   It moreover tries to give an introduction to the main structure of the library and give links to other
   pages for more detailed information.</p>
   In general, libmesh is a finite element (FEM) library
   If not mentioned differently, the functions and variables belong to the namespace "libmesh".
   <p>Libmesh, moreover, uses many <a href="http://libmesh.github.io/externalsoftware.html">external packages</a>.</p>

<h1 id="funct">Functionality</h1>
    <p> One of the main figureheads of libmesh is their adaptive grid refinement, but there are some other functions
    that are quite useful for several applications. </p>
    <p> For some purposes, libmesh offers several options as well. I will try to compare them and find differences 
    between the packages.</p>
    <p> Libmesh is build on top of several other libraries and for many applications further libraries need to 
    be installed. One of these applications are <a href="#lib:systems">eigen systems</a> that require 
    <a href="http://slepc.upv.es">slepc</a> which again needs 
    <a href="http://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/documentation/installation.html">petsc</a> to be installed
    and configured accordingly. This means for example that petsc needs to be installed such that it
    uses <a href="http://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/documentation/installation.html">complex numbers</a>  
    if this is needed for the libmesh-application.</p>

<h2 id="f:tetgen">Generation of Meshes</h2>
    <p> The tool <a href="http://wias-berlin.de/software/tetgen/">tetgen</a> can generate different types of meshes 
    and Delaunay triangulations. That are, for example, Voronoi meshes. </p>
    <p> Libmesh provides qhull as well. This is mentioned only at few places (the code is in 'contrib/qhull'.
    This library can be allowed when installing libmesh by the option '--enable-qhull' </p>
    <p> <font color=”green”>Find out differences between qhull and tetgen! </font></p>

<h2 id="f:infel">infinite elements</h2>
   <p> The libraries for infinite elements are not compiled by default but require an extra option
       in the configure script.</p>
   <p> Related to this option, there are the libraries <a href="#lib:inffe">inf_fe.h</a> and 
       <a href="#lib:inf_el_buld">libmesh/inf_elem_builder.h</a>. </p>

<h1 id="libs">The libraries</h1>
<h2 id="lib:Basic">The Basic libraries</h2>
<p>The most important library is <a href="http://libmesh.github.io/doxygen/libmesh_8h.html">"libmesh/libmesh.h"</a>.
   Its most important functions are the initialisation (and closing) of the library and other libraries 
   depending on it, such as mpi and <a href="#lib:petsc">PETSc</a>. </p>

<p> The second basic library that is needed always is 
    <a href="http://libmesh.github.io/doxygen/mesh_8h.html">mesh.h</a> that provides the  
    <a href="#cl:mesh">class mesh</a> </p>

<h2 id="lib:infel">Finete elements and Related </h2>
<h4 id="lib:mesh_build">building Meshes</h4>
<p>The generation of meshes can be done on several ways. Most basic algorithms are provided by the library
<a href="http://libmesh.github.io/doxygen/namespacelibMesh_1_1MeshTools_1_1Generation.html"></a>mesh_generation.h</p>
 which can build meshes on different geometries.

<h4 id="lib:inffe">infinite elements</h4>
   The library is called  <a href="http://libmesh.github.io/doxygen/inf__fe_8h.html">inf_fe.h</a> internally.
   <p>By this library, three different classes are provided. </p>

<h4 id="lib:inf_el_buld">infinite element builder</h4>
   The <a href="http://libmesh.github.io/doxygen/inf__elem__builder_8h.html">inf_elem_builder</a> provides the 
   only class InfElemBuilder.

<h4 id="lib:systems">Implicit and Explicit System</h4>
   Libmesh provides the libraries 
   <a href="https://libmesh.github.io/doxygen/implicit__system_8h.html">implicit_system.h</a> ,
   <a href="https://libmesh.github.io/doxygen/linear__implicit__system_8h.html">linear_implicit_system.h</a> ,
   <a href="https://libmesh.github.io/doxygen/nonlinear__implicit__system_8h.html">nonlinear_implicit_system.h</a> and
   <a href="https://libmesh.github.io/doxygen/explicit__system_8h.html">explicit_system.h</a>.
   These libraries contain each a class of same name.
   <p> The implicit systems, moreover, have an own solver class which contain different functions to solve 
   liner/nonlinear systems and eigen equations using Laspack, PETSc or other libraries.</p>
   <p>For nonlinear systems, various methods are provided by
   <a href="http://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/documentation/nonlinearsolvertable.html">petsc</a> in addition to 
      solvers implemented in libmesh.</p>
   <!-- <p> The explicit system  </p>-->
   <p><font color="red"> I didn't find any difference between explict and implicit systems yet. </font></p>
   <p><font color="red"> Also, I don't really know what implicit_system.h does. It doesn't seem
      to be a relict; but I didn't find any real functionality for it. </font></p>
   <p>An other important library for a class of systems is <a href="">eigen_system.h</a> which is needed
   e.g. to solve the schroedinger equation for bound particles.</p>

<h2 id="lib:io">Libraries for in- and output</h2>
There are several libraries that handle input and output of meshes and related quantities in different formats.

<h4 id="lib:getpot">GetPot</h4>
   The tool <a href="http://getpot.sourceforge.net/">GetPot</a> is a commandline- and inputfile parser supported
   by libmesh. 

<h4 id="lib:io_exodus">exodus</h4>
   <p> One of the formats of choise is 
      <a href="https://cubit.sandia.gov/public/13.2/help_manual/WebHelp/finite_element_model/export/exporting_exodus2_file.htm">Exodus 2</a> format (.exd) which is a binary format that can be converted to 
      ascii using the tool 'ncdump'. This library is imported by 
      <a href="http://libmesh.github.io/doxygen/exodusII__io_8h.html">libmesh/exodusII_io.h</a> that provides
      an extra <a href="#cl:exodus">class exodusII_IO</a>. </p>

<h4 id="lib:io_xdr">xdr</h4>
   <p>The second format that is important for in- and output is the file format 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_Data_Representation">External Data Representation</a> 'xdr'. 
     This is obtained by an option in installation (by default it seems to be on). </p>
    <p>Note: xdr is supported by other programms and languages such as R as well.</p>
    <p> This file format can be an elegant way to insert a mesh and maybe even an external potential to application
    programms.</p>

<h4 id="lib:io_tec">tecplot</h4>
    <p>Such as exodus, tecplot can handle data in binary as well as ascii format.</p> 

<h4 id="lib:io_misc">miscelangelous</h4>
   <p>There also exists a library <a href="http://libmesh.github.io/doxygen/gnuplot__io_8h.html">gnuplot_io.h</a>
      which is able to handle 1d data only. However, it can be used to create nice gnuplot script and data
      files.</p>

<h2 id="lib:petsc">PETSc</h2>
   The library <a href="http://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/">PETSc</a> is a very powerful tool for vector- and matrix
   operations.
   The developers of PETSc call it "a suite of data structures and routines for the scalable (parallel) solution 
   of scientific applications modeled by partial differential equations." 
   It provides many different solvers for 
   <a href="http://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/documentation/linearsolvertable.html">linear systems</a> where most of 
   them work for complex matrices as well.
   However, many of these functions depend on external packages themselves.
   One important note about this library is that it is not only parallelized in terms of mpi, but supports 
    <a href="http://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/features/gpus.html">cuda and opencl</a> as well.
   <p> PETSc provides a detailed documentation and helps on its homepage.</p>

<h1 id="classes">Important classes</h1> 
   Libmesh is mainly an object oriented library; that means: everything is organised in classes.
   Hence, this collection will contain only the most important classes with some features.

<h2 id="cl:mesh">mesh</h2>
   <p> the class <a href="http://libmesh.github.io/doxygen/classlibMesh_1_1Mesh.html">mesh</a> is the central 
   class in the library libmesh. </p>

<h2 id="cl:exodus_io">Exodus2 for in- and output</h2>
   <p> the class exodus 2 contains several 
    <a href="http://libmesh.github.io/doxygen/classlibMesh_1_1ExodusII__IO.html">elements</a>. </p>
