This programme requires libmesh with some non-standard functions. These are, among some options in the
configuration preinstalled the libraries petsc and slepc.
To make sure it will work for you as well, please install it using the 'install.sh' script.
Check your configuration of libmesh comparing with the 'configs.conf' file.

Good luck; the programme is empty and has no feature yet. 
Feel free to denote any file in this folder as the programme. You may distribute it as you like.

*****************************  TIPPS AND TRICKS FOR INSTALLATION  ************************************************
==================================================================================================================

== Installing required libraries ==
FreeWilly is based on several external libraries which are libmesh and libraries it is based on again.
Installing petsc:
   As PETSc has no support for long double types, libmesh may not be installed with '--enable-tripleprecision'
   as long as your compiler does not support respective type conversions. However, installation with complex 
   numbers and mpi-support (which is needed for the libmesh-interface as it seems) can be done using the 
   configure-options:
    ./configure --with-cc=/usr/bin/mpicc --with-scalar-type=complex --with-precision=double 
    --with-cxx=mpic++ --with-fc=mpif90
   
   The second library that is needed is SLEPC which is build on top of PETSc and copies most of its options
   from the PETSc installation. Therefore, the variables $SLEPC_DIR, $PETSC_DIR and $PETSC_ARCH need to be set.
   Moreover, it can be compiled with further libraries as well as described on the respective home page.

Having these libraries (and facultatively some others) one can install libmesh finally. With the above 
configurations, this should be possible using the './install.sh' script as long as your compiler is able to cast
'double' to 'complex' on the fly. This may be possible by some options to the compiler in use.
