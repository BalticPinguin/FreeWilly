************************************   Welcome to FreeWilly  *************************************
==================================================================================================

Willy is an electron of course!

This program requires libmesh with some non-standard functions. These are, among some options in the
configuration preinstalled the libraries petsc and slepc.
To make sure it will work for you as well, please install it using the 'install.sh' script.
Check your configuration of libmesh comparing with the 'configs.conf' file.

==================================================================================================
*****************************  TIPPS AND TRICKS FOR INSTALLATION  ********************************
==================================================================================================

== Installing required libraries ==
FreeWilly is based on several external libraries which are libmesh and libraries it is based on again.
Installing petsc:
   As PETSc has no support for long double types, libmesh may not be installed with '--enable-tripleprecision'
   as long as your compiler does not support respective type conversions. However, installation with complex 
   numbers and mpi-support (which is needed for the libmesh-interface as it seems) can be done using the 
   configure-options:
    ./configure --with-scalar-type=complex --with-precision=double 
   And use mpi in the configuration!
   
   The second library that is needed is SLEPC which is build on top of PETSc and copies most of its options
   from the PETSc installation. Therefore, the variables $SLEPC_DIR, $PETSC_DIR and $PETSC_ARCH need to be set.
   Moreover, it can be compiled with further libraries as well as described on the respective home page.

Having these libraries (and optionally some others) one can install libmesh finally. With the above 
configurations, this should be possible using the './install.sh' script.

To compile the application (FreeWilly) in debug-mode, type 'export METHOD=dbg' before 'make'. 
This method must be enabled by the libmesh-installation (as it is by default).
For installing FreeWilly finally, first change the first line in the makefile such that it 
points to your libmesh installation.

Good luck!

*****************************  Functions to use in the future  ***********************************
==================================================================================================

Please use at least libMesh-version > 1.0. If no newer version is available, use the current development
tree at https://github.com/libMesh/libmesh . 
Older versions will fail to run this program.
